“My uncle of the most honest rules,
When I didn't get joking,
He forced himself to respect himself
I couldn't invent it better.
His example is other science;
But, my God, what a boser
With the patient to sit and day and night,
Don't walk away from step away!
What is low instection
Resime to amuse,
To correct his pillows,
Inshoot the medicine,
To breathe and think to yourself:
When the hell will take you!”
II
That's what a young hanging thought,
Flying in the dust on the mail,
the Supreme will of Zeve
The inherive of all his family.
Friends of Lyudmila and Ruslan!
With the hero of my novel
Without prefaces, this hour
Let me introduce you:
Onegin, my good friend,
Born on the brebs of the Neva,
Where, perhaps, you were born
Or shining, my reader;
There was no time for me to walk and:
But the north is bad for me1.
III
Serving perfectly noble,
His father lived his father in debts.
Give three balls annually
And finally washed.
The fate of Eugene kept:
FirstMadamefollowed him,
ThenMonsieurChanged her.
The child was a cut, but sweet.
Monsieur l'Abbé, the Frenchman's brog,
So that the child is not to be torn,
He taught him all jokingly,
Did not acumnach a strict morality,
Slightly for the cranky bril
And in the Summer Garden, he drove.
IV
When the youth of the rebellious
It is time for Eugene,
It is a beast of hope and sadness,
Monsieurdrove out of the yard.
Here is my Onegin free;
Saw the last fashion,
Howdandy 2London dressed –
I finally saw the light.
He is in French completely
He can express and write;
Easy to dance
And he claned with ease;
What else do you do with? The light decided,
That he's a lot of sweet and very nice.
V
We all studied a little
Something and some,
So by the education, thank God,
We have a nasron.
Onegin was according to many
(Adgues of Decisive and Stoo)
Scientary, but pedant:
He had a happy talent
Without coercion in conversation
Touch to everything a little,
With the scientific type of connoisseur
Keeping the Silence in an Important Dispute
And exciting a smile ladies
Fire of unexplored epigrams.
VI
Latin is now out of fashion:
So, if you tell the truth,
He knew quite Latin,
to understand the epigraphs,
To be wakoy about Juvenale,
At the end of the letter putValale,
I remember, not without sin,
There are two verses from Aneida.
He had no hunting
In Chronological Dust
The Earth:
But the days of the past anecdotes
From Romul to the Present Day
He was in his memory.
VII
High passion without
For the sounds of life not to spare,
He couldn't have a yamba from the chorea,
No matter how we fought, to distinguish.
Branil Homer, Theocrit;
The Adam Smith
It was a deep economy,
I mean, he knew how to judge,
How the state is rich,
And what lives, and why
He doesn't need gold,
WhenSimple Producthas.
His father could not understand him
And the land was pledged.
VIII
All that Eugene knew,
To retell me a lack of aiser;
But what the true genius was,
What he knew was harder for all the sciences,
What was the cold for him
And labor, and torever, and joy,
What took a whole day
His utering lazily,
The science of tender passion,
Which the Nazon eded,
What he finished the sufferer
Your century is brilliant and rebellious
In Moldova, in the wilders of the steppes,
Far away in Italy its own.
IX
X
How early he could hypocritize,
To tarit hope, to be jealous,
To make believe, to believe,
To be dark, to be torn,
Be proud and obedient,
attentively and indifferent!
How tamy he was silent,
How clunky blushing,
In heart letters as unsalked!
One breath, one loving,
How he knew how to forget himself!
How his eyes was fast and unfeed,
He is shamed and dazzy, and sometimes
Shatt a dud tear!
XI
How he knew how to seem new,
It is a joke to be insane,
To be amament ready-made,
A pleasant flatulent to amuse,
To blame a minute of tossing,
Inn for Years of Prejuvant
The desire and passion to win,
Unwitting affecture to expect,
To be prayed and to demand recognition,
Listen to the heart the first sound,
chasing love, and suddenly
Aatume a secret date...
And then she's alone
Give lessons in silence!
XII
How early he could disturb
Hearts of note-to-stories!
When I wanted to destroy
His rivals,
How sarkey he was sar.
What chains I cooked them!
But you, blessed husbands,
You were friends with him:
His husband was lychebling,
The long-time student,
And an infiable old man,
And the majestic-bearing,
Always satisfied with yourself,
Your lunch and wife.
XIII. XIV
XV
He was still in bed:
Notes are carried to him.
What? Invitias? In fact,
Three houses for the evening called:
There will be a ball, there is a children's party.
Where will my plaquer go?
Who will he start with? It doesn't matter:
It's a hit to sit.
While there is a place in the morning's,
Nading wideBoliev 3,
Onegin goes to Boulevard
And there walks in the space,
While the unsused bregnet
He's not about lunch.
XVI
It's dark: he's sitting in singing.
“Pood, get it!” – there was a cry;
Frost dust is silver
His beaver collar.
KTalon 4He was sure,
What awaits him Kaverin.
In the way: and a traffic jam in the ceiling,
The wine of the comet was thrown.
In the previousroast-beefblooded,
And truffing, the luxury of young years,
French cuisine is the best color,
And Strasbourg pie is net
Between the Limburg living cheese
And pineapprome gold.
XVII
More glasses ardors ask for
Pour hot fat of the cutlet,
But the ringing of the beret brings them,
The new ballet started.
The theater is an evil legislator,
Non-permanded Adornner
Charming actresses,
Honorary citizen of the scene,
Onegin flew to the theater,
Where everyone is breathing,
Ready to patentrechat,
Snick the Fed, Cleopatra,
Moin call (for that,
I just have to hear him).
XVIII
The magic land! There in the old years,
Satire is a brave ruler,
Fonvisin, a friend of freedom,
And the responsive princess;
There are unwitting lakes
Folk tears, applauds
With the young Semenova divided;
There our Catenin resurrected
Cornel of genius majestic;
There brought Koska Shakhovskaya
Your comedy is a noisy roy,
There and Didlo were crowned with glory,
There, there under the singing of the kulis
My young days rushed.
XIX
My goddesses! What are you? Where are you?
Heed that I will read:
Are you the same? Other virgins,
Changed, not replaced you?
Will I hear your choirs again?
I'd bess a Russian Terpsichores
Soul Fleeing Fleeing?
Ill-dolful eye will not find
Familiar faces on the stage boring,
And, rushing to an alien light
Disappointed lornet,
The cheerful viewer is indifferent,
Siless I will yawn
And remember the old?
XX
The theater is full; the beds shine;
Parter and chairs - everything is boiling;
In the rayry, impatiently bald,
And, having lysed, the curtain makes noise.
brilliant, half-air,
The blush is obedient to the magic,
The ynas is surrounded by a crowd,
It is worth is is; it,
One foot touching the floor,
The other slowly circles,
And suddenly jumping, and suddenly flies,
Flying like the lips of Eol;
It's the camp will get a thing, it'll develop
And a quick foot of the knife beats.
XXI
It's all cling. The ying is included,
Going between the chairs on the legs,
Double lornet sly slying
On the beds of unfassed ladies;
All the tiers vigored with vigor,
Everything has seen: faces, cleaning
He is erereratiously dissatisfied;
With men from all sides
I bowed, then on stage
In the great scattering looked,
He turned away, and yawned,
He said, “It’s time for you to replace.
I have been patient with the ballets for a long time,
But I'm also tired of it.5.
XXII
More amurs, devils, snakes
They jump and make noise on the stage.
Still tired Lakes
On the furs at the entrance sleep;
Haven't stopped drowning yet,
Tossed, cough, shutt, clap;
Still outside and inside
Flashes everywhere;
Still, essing, the horses beat,
Asserrated by his harness,
And the coach, around the lights,
They'd rip their lords and beat in the palhony -
And Onegin went out;
He's going home.
XXII
I will depict in the picture faithful
A single office,
Where the mod is an example educator
Do you dress, dressed and dressed again?
Everything that is for the whisout of abundant
Trades London acrupt
And on the Baltic Waves
For the forest and fat heales us,
Everything that is hungry in Paris tastes,
Useful fishing by choosing,
Invents for fun,
For luxury, for mud is fashionable,
Everything adored the office
Philosophy at eighteen years old.
XXIV
Amber on the tubes of Tsaregrad,
Porcelain and bronze on the table,
And, the senses of the safe of joy,
Spirits in face-range crystal;
Greys, steel sawdust,
Straight scalbil and curves
And the brushes of thirty genera
For the nails and teeth.
Rousseau (sight in passing)
Couldn't understand how important Grime
Sme the nails in front of him,
The Interesting Crame6.
Defender of Volatility and Rights
In this case, wrong.
XXV
You can be a business person
Thinking about the beauty of nails:
Why argue with the century?
The custom of despot between people.
Second Chadayev, my Evgeny,
Fun of jealous condemnation,
In his clothes was a pedant
And what we called the French.
He's three hours at least
In the pre-mirrors held
And from the left went out
A similar windy Venus,
When, wearing a man's outfit,
The goddess goes to the masquot.
XXVI
Last Taste of the toilet
When you look at your curious look,
I could have light in the for scientists
Here to describe his outfit;
Of course it would be brave,
To describe my case:
Butpantaloons, a cam, vest,
All these words are not in Russian;
And I see, I'm to bet in you,
What is so my poor sylogger
Mott in a lot less could
In the intach-singed words,
I looked old
In the Academic Dictionary.
XXVII
We now have the wrong subject:
We'd better hurry to the ball,
Where the aspired head in a yam carriage
My Onegin rode.
In front of the dead houses
Along the sleepy street in rows
Double Lights of Karet
Funny light pouring
And the rainbows are on the snow;
He's besea with around,
The magnificent house is shining;
In whole windows of the shadows,
Head profiles flash
And I'll give you fashionable weird erritudes.
XXVIII
Here our hero came to the Sens.
Swiss past a arrow
He took off the marble steps,
He straighted the hair with a hand,
Camted in. Full of the people of the hall;
Music is tired of rattundering;
The crowd is occupied with an taz;
Circumcise and noise and tights;
Brenchat of the calard spowl;
Fly feet of cut ladies;
In their captivative footprints
Flying plastorial eyes,
And the ogrim's hide is silenced
A erriful whith of fashionable wives.
XXIX
In the days of amusing and desires
I was crazy about balls:
There is no place for recognition
And to deliver the letter.
O you, honored spouses!
I will offer you your services;
Please note my speech:
I want to warn you.
You also, mothers, harder
For the daughters, look at the following:
Keep your lornet straight!
Not that... Not that, to be spare, God for free!
That's why I'm writing,
That I haven't sined for a long time.
XXX
Ala, for different fun
I ruined a lot of life!
If it weren't for the manners,
I've still loved balls.
I love babe young,
And tight, and shine, and joy,
And I will give a deliberate order;
I love their legs; only not only
You will be in Russia
Three pairs of thaired women's legs.
Oh! I could not forget for a long time
Two legs... Sad, chooled,
I remember them all, and in my dream
They're disturbing my heart.
XXXI
When and where, in what desert,
Insane, you're gonna forget them?
Ah, legs, legs! Where are you now?
Where are the flowers?
Cleved in the eastern negaté,
On the northern, sad snow
You left no trace:
Loved the soft are the movlens
Luxury touch.
I have long forgotten for you
And the crady of glory and praise,
And the edge of the fathers, and very much?
The happiness of the young years,
As in the out of your light, your light trail.
XXXII
Diana Breasts, Lanits Flora
Lovely, dear friends!
However, the leg Terpsichore
It's more beautiful to me.
She, prophesying the look
Unapperated reward,
Intex with conditional beauty
Desire willful roy.
I love her, my friend Elvina,
Under a long tableset of tables,
In the spring on the ant of the buto.
In winter, on the cast iron,
On the mirrored floor hall,
The sea is on the granite of rocks.
XXXIII
I remember the sea in the thunderstorm:
As I was jealous of the waves,
Running a stormy erre
With love to lie down to her feet!
How I wanted with the waves then
Touch the cut of your feet with your mouth!
No, never in the middle of arding days
Bottling the Youngness of Mine
I didn't want to be so tormented
To the mouth of the Young Armids,
I's a flamed flamed roses,
Ir in persi, full of bluffing;
No, never a vesm of passion
So I didn't torfor mine's soul!
XXXIV
I remember another time!
In the cherished sometimes dreams
I'm holding a happy aspire...
And I feel the knife in my hands;
The imagination is boiling again,
Her touch again
He blew in the blood that is withered heart,
It's a vessy again, love again!
But full of praise
A chattaty lipro of his own;
They are not worth the passions,
No songs inspired by them:
Words and eyes of the sorcerers of the sorcer
They's bayy... like their feet.
XXXV
What's my Onegin? Half-sleep
In the Bed, he goes:
A Petersburg non-cousing
The drum is waking up.
The merchant stands, the crassmanner is coming,
On the stock is drawn by the drawer,
With a judah, the ohshtka is in a hurry,
Snow is tiled under it.
The noise was pleasant in the morning.
Open shutters; tube smoke
The column rises blue,
And the bread, the German neat,
In a paper cap, for once
He has annit hisVasisdas.
XXXVI
But, the noise of the ball was wet
And the morning at midnight,
Sleeping calmly in the shadow of the blessed
A child's gorge and luxuries.
It's a blahtunch in half a day, and again
His life is ready until the morning,
It's a monotonous and a variety.
Tomorrow is the same as yesterday.
But was my Eugene happy,
Free, in the color of the best years,
Among the brilliant victories,
Among the day-ding from the day?
Was he in the mid
Uncautious and healthy?
XXXVII
No: the feelings in it cooled early.
He was bored of light noise;
The beauties weren't long
The subject of his usual thoughts;
The betrayals have time to be exhausted;
Friends and friendship are tired,
What he could not always
Beef-steaksand Strasburg Pirot
Champagne pour a bottle
And to pour sharp words,
When the head hurt;
And even though he was a ardor hang,
But he finally fell out of love
And swearing, and sword, and lead.
XXXVIII
The disease that causes
It's time to find it,
Similar to EnglishSplenu,
In short: RussianKhandra
She took a little bit of it.
He's shot, thank God,
He didn't want to try,
But he completely ceded to life.
HowChild-Harold,grimed, ummarc
He appeared in the living rooms;
No grossing of light, not Boston,
Not a sweet look, no sigh,
Nothing touched him,
He didn't notice anything.
XXXIX. XL. XLI
XLII
The angy wode of the world!
He left you all before.
And the truth is that in our summers
The highest tone is bore;
Maybe a other lady
Interpreted by Soy and Bentham,
But in general, their conversation
Unbearable, even innocent nonsense;
Besides, they are so unsingly,
So majestic, so clever,
So the piet is full,
So careful, so accurate,
So inapperignable to men,
What is the type of them gives birthSplin 7.
XLIII
And you, the beauties are young,
Which is late sometimes
The trembling is carried
On the St. Petersburg bridge,
And I'd left you Eugene.
The apostal of turbulent pleasures,
Onegin at home locked himself,
Zin, for the feathers,
I wanted to write – but hard work
He was soluded; nothing
Didn't come out of his pen,
And he didn't get into the shop ently entlying
People, of which I do not judge,
The fact that I belong to them.
XLIV
And again, loyal to the improvised,
empting in the spiritual emptiness,
He sat up with a commendable purpose
To appropriate the mind of a stranger;
The series set the series,
I read, read, and all in no sense:
There's bored, there's deceiving and delusional,
In that conscience, there is no sense;
For all different things;
And old man is outdated,
And old is gently gently syms.
As women, he left books,
And the hedal, with their family dusty,
He pulled the truck with a truck.
XLV
The conditions of light overwalken the burden,
As he, behind the fuss,
I was befriending him at the time.
I liked his traits,
Involuntary devotion to the dreams,
Inscenced oddity
And a sharp, chilled mind.
I was angry, he was ugly;
Passion games we both knew.
It was the life of both of us.
In both hearts, the heat extinguished;
They expected an anger
The blind Fortune and the People
In the very third of our days.
XLVI
Whoever lived and thought cannot
In the soul do not thirstint people;
Who felt, he disturbs
The ghost of non-graved days:
Tom has no charm,
that serpension of memories,
The repentance is biting.
All this often gives
Great beauty with conversation.
First Onegin's tongue
I was embarrassed by; but I'm used to
To his sarin dispute,
And to the joke, with the hair in half,
And anger of dark epigrams.
XLVII
How often summer,
When it is transparent and light
The Night Sky Over the Néqué8
And the water is a fun glass
Does not reflect Diana's face,
Remes the old years of romances,
When remembering the former love,
Sensitive, careless again,
The Breath of the Sedvious Night
We're silent!
As in the forest green from prison
The well is carried over the sleep,
That's how we're dreamed of
At the beginning of life young.
XLVIII
With a soul full of regret,
And leaning on granite,
It was Eugene,
How to describe himself pie9.
Everything was quiet; only the night
The clock,
Yes trembling distant knock
Suddenly, Milonna,
Only a boat, a sankhovyah,
Floating on the asttecting river:
And we were captivified in the distance
The Hors and Song is Deleted...
But sweeter, in the midnight fun,
Singing the Torquat octas!
XLIX
Adriatic waves,
Oh Brent! No, I'm I'm ah, I'm
And, inspiration again full,
I will hear your magic voice!
He is holy to the grandchildren of Apollo;
The Proud Lire of Albion
He knows me, he's my family.
Italian Nights of the Golden
I'll enjoy it in the will,
With Venetian mother,
It's a talky, it's mut,
Singing in a mysterious gondola;
With her will find my mouth
The language of the Petrarch and love.
L
Will the hour of my freedom come?
Come on, come on! I appeal to her;
The Broadm of the Sea10, waiting for the weather,
Maneus were in the ship.
Under the guise of storms, with waves arguing,
At the free distangle of the sea
When will I start running free?
It is a yus.
I'm hostile to the elements
And in the mid-yais,
Under the Sky of Africa11,
To breathe on a dark Russia,
Where I suffered, where I loved,
Where I buried my heart.
LI
Onegin was ready with me
Seeing foreign countries;
But soon we were fate
Long term divorced.
His father died then.
In front of Onegin gathered
The greedy regiment of the queer.
Everyone has their own mind and sense:
Eugene, hated the liters,
Squeal of his lot,
Inherence provided them,
No big loss in it
Ily foreteting from a distance
The man's uncle's eddy.
LIII
Sudden of Sudden he actually got
From the report of the .
What an Uncle at Death in Bed
And I would be happy to say goodby it.
He will have a sad message,
Eugene immediately on a date
Stremdlav by mail sk-scatlav
And yawned in advance,
Getting there, money for the sake,
On sighs, bosers and deceiving
(And so I started my novel).
But when he arrives in the village of his uncle,
found him on the table,
It's like a tribute to the finished land.
LIII
He has reached the courtyard of services;
The deceased from all sides
Others and others came,
Hunters before the funeral.
The deceased was buried.
Butes and guests ate, drinking
And then the important dispersed,
It's like you's done it.
Here is our Onegin - a rural resident,
Plants, waters, forests, lands
The owner is full, and the village
Order of the enemy and the fra.
I am very glad that the previous path
Changed to something.
LIV
Two days he seemed to be nova
United fields,
A short-haul of a dark oak,
The murmur of a quiet stream;
On the third grod, hill and field
It was not occupied by him.
Then they were dreamed.
Then he saw clearly,
What is the same in the village,
There are no streets, no palaces,
No maps, no balls, no verses.
Handra was waiting for him on guard,
And she ran for him,
It's like a shadow of a faithful wife.
LV
I was born for a peaceful life,
For rusty of rusty;
In the wilderly sounder than the lyr voice,
Lively creative dreams.
Dedicate to the innocent,
I bake over the desert lake,
Andfar nienteMy law.
I'm awakening every morning
For sweet nons and freedom:
I read a little, I drink for a long time,
I don't catch batchest.
Am I not in the years
He was inactive, in the shadows
My happiest days?
LVI
Flowers, love, village, Idleness,
Paules! I am loyal to you.
I am always happy to notice the difference
Between Onegin and Me,
To make a ridicule reader
Or some publisher
Intricate defle.
When I find my traits here,
Didn't repeat it next to you,
That I have maritaled my portrait,
As byron, the pride of the poet,
As if we were impossible
Write poems about the other,
As soon as it's about myself.
LVII
I will note: all poets -
Love of dreaming friends.
It be, cutes.
I dreamed, and my soul
Their image of the secret has preserved;
After the musa, they were revived:
So I, he's so, I've ingsed
And the virgin of the mountains, my ideal,
And the captives of the coast of Salgir.
Now from you, my friends,
I often hear the question:
“O you who your lira is zighing?
To whom, in the crowd of jealous virgins,
You dedicated her to the singing?
LVIII
What is the eye, exciting inspiration,
The SMerous beska awarded
Your thoughtful penal?
Who did your verse idols?
And, friends, no one, by God!
Love is an insane alarm
I've experienced jo-noble.
Blessed is who combined with it
Fuel Rift: He Doubled Them
Sacred deliria,
Petrarch, followed by
And the tooth of the heart calmed down,
I also caught the glory in the meantime.
But I loved to be stupid and him.
LIX
Love passed, there was a musa,
And the dark mind became clear.
Free, looking for an alliance again
Magic sounds, feelings and thoughts;
I write, and my heart does not abe-singing,
The pen, forgets, does not draw,
Near the unfinished poems,
No women's legs, no heads;
The extinguished ashes will not break,
I'm sad, but I'm not sad,
And soon, soon storm traces
In my soul will completely calm:
Then I'll start writing
Songs in twenty-five.
LX
I thought about the form of the plan
And as a hero I will name;
While the place of my novel
I finished the first chapter;
I have revised all this strictly:
There are a lot of contradictions,
But I don't want to fix them.
Cenzour debt pays your debt
And journalists on eating
I will give the fruit of my work:
And you to the Neva banks,
Newborn creation,
And deserve glory to me, tribute:
Curved talk, noise and swearing!




















“My uncle of the most honest rules,
“O you who your lira is zighing?
“Pood, get it!” – there was a cry;
(Adgues of Decisive and Stoo)
(And so I started my novel).
A chattaty lipro of his own;
A child's gorge and luxuries.
A erriful whith of fashionable wives.
A Petersburg non-cousing
A pleasant flatulent to amuse,
A short-haul of a dark oak,
A similar windy Venus,
A single office,
Aatume a secret date...
Adriatic waves,
After the musa, they were revived:
Ah, legs, legs! Where are you now?
Ala, for different fun
All that Eugene knew,
All the tiers vigored with vigor,
All these words are not in Russian;
All this often gives
Along the sleepy street in rows
Always satisfied with yourself,
Am I not in the years
Amber on the tubes of Tsaregrad,
Among the brilliant victories,
Among the day-ding from the day?
And, friends, no one, by God!
And, having lysed, the curtain makes noise.
And, inspiration again full,
And, rushing to an alien light
And, the senses of the safe of joy,
And a quick foot of the knife beats.
And a sharp, chilled mind.
And again, loyal to the improvised,
And an infiable old man,
And anger of dark epigrams.
And as a hero I will name;
And deserve glory to me, tribute:
And even though he was a ardor hang,
And exciting a smile ladies
And finally washed.
And from the left went out
And he claned with ease;
And he didn't get into the shop ently entlying
And I'd left you Eugene.
And I feel the knife in my hands;
And I'll give you fashionable weird erritudes.
And I see, I'm to bet in you,
And I will give a deliberate order;
And I would be happy to say goodby it.
And in the mid-yais,
And in the Summer Garden, he drove.
And journalists on eating
And labor, and torever, and joy,
And leaning on granite,
And old is gently gently syms.
And old man is outdated,
And on the Baltic Waves
And Onegin went out;
And pineapprome gold.
And remember the old?
And she ran for him,
And soon, soon storm traces
And Strasbourg pie is net
And suddenly jumping, and suddenly flies,
And swearing, and sword, and lead.
And the bread, the German neat,
And the brushes of thirty genera
And the captives of the coast of Salgir.
And the coach, around the lights,
And the crady of glory and praise,
And the dark mind became clear.
And the edge of the fathers, and very much?
And the hedal, with their family dusty,
And the land was pledged.
And the majestic-bearing,
And the morning at midnight,
And the ogrim's hide is silenced
And the rainbows are on the snow;
And the responsive princess;
And the tooth of the heart calmed down,
And the truth is that in our summers
And the virgin of the mountains, my ideal,
And the water is a fun glass
And then she's alone
And then the important dispersed,
And there walks in the space,
And tight, and shine, and joy,
And to deliver the letter.
And to pour sharp words,
And to the joke, with the hair in half,
And truffing, the luxury of young years,
And we were captivified in the distance
And what lives, and why
And what we called the French.
And yawned in advance,
And you, the beauties are young,
And you to the Neva banks,
Andfar nienteMy law.
Are you the same? Other virgins,
As byron, the pride of the poet,
As he, behind the fuss,
As I was jealous of the waves,
As if we were impossible
As in the forest green from prison
As in the out of your light, your light trail.
As soon as it's about myself.
As women, he left books,
Asserrated by his harness,
At the beginning of life young.

At the free distangle of the sea

But, my God, what a boser
But, the noise of the ball was wet
But full of praise
But he completely ceded to life.
But he finally fell out of love
But I don't want to fix them.
But I loved to be stupid and him.
But I'm also tired of it.5.
But in general, their conversation
But soon we were fate
But sweeter, in the midnight fun,
But the days of the past anecdotes
But the north is bad for me1.
But the ringing of the beret brings them,
But was my Eugene happy,
But what the true genius was,
But when he arrives in the village of his uncle,
But you, blessed husbands,
Butes and guests ate, drinking
Butpantaloons, a cam, vest,
Camted in. Full of the people of the hall;
Cenzour debt pays your debt
Champagne pour a bottle
Changed, not replaced you?
Changed to something.
Charming actresses,
chasing love, and suddenly
Circumcise and noise and tights;

Dedicate to the innocent,
Defender of Volatility and Rights

Everyone has their own mind and sense:
Everything adored the office
Everything has seen: faces, cleaning
Everything that is for the whisout of abundant
Everything that is hungry in Paris tastes,
Everything was quiet; only the night
Familiar faces on the stage boring,
Far away in Italy its own.
Fire of unexplored epigrams.

For rusty of rusty;
For sweet nons and freedom:

For the forest and fat heales us,
For the nails and teeth.
For the sounds of life not to spare,

Free, looking for an alliance again

Handra was waiting for him on guard,
Haven't stopped drowning yet,
He appeared in the living rooms;
He blew in the blood that is withered heart,
He can express and write;
He couldn't have a yamba from the chorea,
He didn't notice anything.
He didn't want to try,
He doesn't need gold,
He forced himself to respect himself
He had a happy talent
He had no hunting
He has annit hisVasisdas.
He has reached the courtyard of services;
He is erereratiously dissatisfied;
He is holy to the grandchildren of Apollo;
He is in French completely
He is shamed and dazzy, and sometimes
He knew quite Latin,
He knows me, he's my family.
He left you all before.
He pulled the truck with a truck.
He's besea with around,
He's going home.
He's not about lunch.
He's shot, thank God,
He's three hours at least
He said, “It’s time for you to replace.
He sat up with a commendable purpose
He straighted the hair with a hand,
He taught him all jokingly,
He took off the marble steps,
He turned away, and yawned,
He was bored of light noise;
He was in his memory.
He was inactive, in the shadows
He was soluded; nothing
He was still in bed:
He will have a sad message,
Head profiles flash
Hearts of note-to-stories!
Heed that I will read:
Her touch again
Here is my Onegin free;
Here is our Onegin - a rural resident,
Here our hero came to the Sens.
Here to describe his outfit;
High passion without
His beaver collar.
His example is other science;
His father could not understand him
His father died then.
His father lived his father in debts.
His husband was lychebling,
His life is ready until the morning,
His rivals,
His utering lazily,
Honorary citizen of the scene,
How clunky blushing,
How early he could disturb
How early he could hypocritize,
How he knew how to forget himself!
How he knew how to seem new,
How his eyes was fast and unfeed,
How I wanted with the waves then
How often summer,
How sarkey he was sar.
How tamy he was silent,
How the state is rich,
How to describe himself pie9.

I liked his traits,
I'll enjoy it in the will,
I looked old
I love babe young,
I love her, my friend Elvina,
I love their legs; only not only
I'm awakening every morning
I'm holding a happy aspire...
I'm hostile to the elements
I'm sad, but I'm not sad,
I mean, he knew how to judge,
I often hear the question:
I read, read, and all in no sense:
I read a little, I drink for a long time,
I remember, not without sin,
I remember another time!
I remember the sea in the thunderstorm:
I remember them all, and in my dream
I ruined a lot of life!
I's a flamed flamed roses,
I thought about the form of the plan
I've experienced jo-noble.
I've still loved balls.
I want to warn you.
I wanted to write – but hard work
I was angry, he was ugly;
I was befriending him at the time.
I was born for a peaceful life,
I was crazy about balls:
I was embarrassed by; but I'm used to
I will depict in the picture faithful
I will give the fruit of my work:
I will hear your magic voice!
I will note: all poets -

In both hearts, the heat extinguished;
In Chronological Dust

In front of the dead houses
In heart letters as unsalked!

In Moldova, in the wilders of the steppes,
In my soul will completely calm:
In short: RussianKhandra
In that conscience, there is no sense;
In the Academic Dictionary.
In the Bed, he goes:
In the cherished sometimes dreams
In the days of amusing and desires
In the great scattering looked,
In the intach-singed words,
In the pre-mirrors held
In the previousroast-beefblooded,
In the rayry, impatiently bald,
In the soul do not thirstint people;
In the spring on the ant of the buto.
In the very third of our days.
In the way: and a traffic jam in the ceiling,
In the wilderly sounder than the lyr voice,
In their captivative footprints

In winter, on the cast iron,

It is a beast of hope and sadness,
It is a joke to be insane,
It is a yus.
It is time for Eugene,
It is worth is is; it,
It's a blahtunch in half a day, and again
It's a hit to sit.
It's a monotonous and a variety.
It's a talky, it's mut,
It's a vessy again, love again!
It's all cling. The ying is included,
It's dark: he's sitting in singing.
It's like a shadow of a faithful wife.
It's like a tribute to the finished land.
It's like you's done it.
It's more beautiful to me.
It's the camp will get a thing, it'll develop
It's time to find it,
It was a deep economy,
It was Eugene,
It was not occupied by him.
It was the life of both of us.

Suddenly, Milonna,

That I have maritaled my portrait,
That I haven't sined for a long time.
That's how we're dreamed of
That's what a young hanging thought,
That's why I'm writing,
that serpension of memories,
The Adam Smith
The angy wode of the world!
The apostal of turbulent pleasures,
The beauties weren't long
The betrayals have time to be exhausted;
The blind Fortune and the People

The Breath of the Sedvious Night
The Broadm of the Sea10, waiting for the weather,
The cheerful viewer is indifferent,
The child was a cut, but sweet.
The clock,
The column rises blue,
The conditions of light overwalken the burden,
The crowd is occupied with an taz;
The custom of despot between people.
The deceased from all sides
The deceased was buried.
The desire and passion to win,
The disease that causes
The drum is waking up.
The Earth:
The extinguished ashes will not break,
The fact that I belong to them.
The fate of Eugene kept:
The ghost of non-graved days:
The goddess goes to the masquot.
The greedy regiment of the queer.
The happiness of the young years,

The Hors and Song is Deleted...
The imagination is boiling again,

The murmur of a quiet stream;
The new ballet started.
The Night Sky Over the Néqué8
The noise was pleasant in the morning.

The owner is full, and the village
The pen, forgets, does not draw,

The sea is on the granite of rocks.
The series set the series,
The SMerous beska awarded
The subject of his usual thoughts;
the Supreme will of Zeve
The theater is an evil legislator,
The theater is full; the beds shine;
The trembling is carried
The well is carried over the sleep,
The wine of the comet was thrown.

Their image of the secret has preserved;

Then I'll start writing
Then they were dreamed.

There, there under the singing of the kulis
There and Didlo were crowned with glory,
There are a lot of contradictions,
There are no streets, no palaces,
There are two verses from Aneida.
There are unwitting lakes
There brought Koska Shakhovskaya
There is no place for recognition
There our Catenin resurrected
There's bored, there's deceiving and delusional,
There was no time for me to walk and:
There will be a ball, there is a children's party.
They are not worth the passions,
They'd rip their lords and beat in the palhony -
They expected an anger
They jump and make noise on the stage.
They're disturbing my heart.
They's bayy... like their feet.
Thinking about the beauty of nails:
Three houses for the evening called:
Three pairs of thaired women's legs.
To appropriate the mind of a stranger;
To be amament ready-made,
To be dark, to be torn,
To be prayed and to demand recognition,
To be wakoy about Juvenale,
To blame a minute of tossing,
To breathe and think to yourself:
To breathe on a dark Russia,
To correct his pillows,
To describe my case:
To his sarin dispute,
To make a ridicule reader
To make believe, to believe,
To retell me a lack of aiser;
To tarit hope, to be jealous,
To the mouth of the Young Armids,
to understand the epigraphs,
To whom, in the crowd of jealous virgins,
Tom has no charm,
Tomorrow is the same as yesterday.
Tossed, cough, shutt, clap;
Touch the cut of your feet with your mouth!
Touch to everything a little,

Two days he seemed to be nova
Two legs... Sad, chooled,
Unapperated reward,
Unbearable, even innocent nonsense;
Uncautious and healthy?

Under the guise of storms, with waves arguing,
Under the Sky of Africa11,
United fields,
Unwitting affecture to expect,
Useful fishing by choosing,

What awaits him Kaverin.
What chains I cooked them!
What else do you do with? The light decided,
What he could not always
What he finished the sufferer

While there is a place in the morning's,

Whoever lived and thought cannot
Why argue with the century?
Will I hear your choirs again?
Will the hour of my freedom come?
With a judah, the ohshtka is in a hurry,
With a soul full of regret,
With her will find my mouth
With love to lie down to her feet!
With men from all sides
With the hero of my novel
With the patient to sit and day and night,
With the scientific type of connoisseur

With Venetian mother,

Without prefaces, this hour

And swearing, and sword, and lead.
Heed that I will read:
Amber on the tubes of Tsaregrad,
He was still in bed:
How his eyes was fast and unfeed,
And the land was pledged.
And finally washed.
He is erereratiously dissatisfied;
He turned away, and yawned,
Friends and friendship are tired,
And again, loyal to the improvised,
And then the important dispersed,
And old man is outdated,
After the musa, they were revived:
And remember the old?
He doesn't need gold,
And pineapprome gold.
He straighted the hair with a hand,
And a sharp, chilled mind.
He's besea with around,
He's shot, thank God,
And, friends, no one, by God!

Flashes everywhere;
He left you all before.
At the free distangle of the sea
And he claned with ease;
And the crady of glory and praise,
And, having lysed, the curtain makes noise.
He was bored of light noise;
Everyone has their own mind and sense:
But, my God, what a boser
A pleasant flatulent to amuse,
And leaning on granite,
He can express and write;
But the days of the past anecdotes
And deserve glory to me, tribute:
And on the Baltic Waves
All this often gives
Frost dust is silver
And in the Summer Garden, he drove.
But, the noise of the ball was wet
How early he could hypocritize,
And to the joke, with the hair in half,
How he knew how to forget himself!
Always satisfied with yourself,
As soon as it's about myself.
And even though he was a ardor hang,
“O you who your lira is zighing?
How clunky blushing,
Changed to something.
He didn't notice anything.
His husband was lychebling,

How the state is rich,
And what we called the French.

And the edge of the fathers, and very much?
And, rushing to an alien light
Everything was quiet; only the night
For the nails and teeth.
And what lives, and why
Blessed is who combined with it
Free, looking for an alliance again

His father could not understand him
A short-haul of a dark oak,
He pulled the truck with a truck.
And the virgin of the mountains, my ideal,

He is in French completely

Friends of Lyudmila and Ruslan!
And an infiable old man,
His father died then.
He had a happy talent
Didn't come out of his pen,
Do you dress, dressed and dressed again?
He was soluded; nothing
Butes and guests ate, drinking
Bottling the Youngness of Mine
Everything has seen: faces, cleaning
Funny light pouring
A Petersburg non-cousing
And journalists on eating
He knew quite Latin,
He had no hunting
Double lornet sly slying
And he didn't get into the shop ently entlying
Fun of jealous condemnation,
Great beauty with conversation.
And then she's alone
But sweeter, in the midnight fun,
A chattaty lipro of his own;
Far away in Italy its own.

But in general, their conversation

For all different things;
But full of praise
And in the mid-yais,
And you to the Neva banks,
As women, he left books,
His rivals,
Fire of unexplored epigrams.
And anger of dark epigrams.
He appeared in the living rooms;
And old is gently gently syms.
Here our hero came to the Sens.
Are you the same? Other virgins,
He sat up with a commendable purpose
He took off the marble steps,
And truffing, the luxury of young years,
Free, in the color of the best years,
Eugene, hated the liters,
And the responsive princess;
Flowers, love, village, Idleness,
empting in the spiritual emptiness,
Asserrated by his harness,
As he, behind the fuss,
And a quick foot of the knife beats.
His father lived his father in debts.
And the coach, around the lights,
Circumcise and noise and tights;
For the forest and fat heales us,
A similar windy Venus,
Eugene immediately on a date
And the bread, the German neat,
But soon we were fate
Disappointed lornet,
As byron, the pride of the poet,
Haven't stopped drowning yet,
And the morning at midnight,
Defender of Volatility and Rights
And I would be happy to say goodby it.
Here to describe his outfit;
Branil Homer, Theocrit;
Dedicate to the innocent,
Here is our Onegin - a rural resident,
Be proud and obedient,
How tamy he was silent,
attentively and indifferent!
He blew in the blood that is withered heart,
Butpantaloons, a cam, vest,
Greys, steel sawdust,
And Onegin went out;
Ala, for different fun
First Onegin's tongue
And from the left went out
High passion without
Changed, not replaced you?
And I see, I'm to bet in you,
Didn't repeat it next to you,
But he finally fell out of love
Andfar nienteMy law.
How he knew how to seem new,
All that Eugene knew,
He was inactive, in the shadows
Ah, legs, legs! Where are you now?
And the rainbows are on the snow;
Along the sleepy street in rows
Among the day-ding from the day?
Don't walk away from step away!
He taught him all jokingly,
Besides, they are so unsingly,
He knows me, he's my family.
His utering lazily,
And tight, and shine, and joy,
And labor, and torever, and joy,
And, the senses of the safe of joy,
Desire willful roy.
But was my Eugene happy,
“Pood, get it!” – there was a cry;
He was in his memory.
He didn't want to try,
Did not acumnach a strict morality,
And the hedal, with their family dusty,
For rusty of rusty;

I will note: all poets -
I remember them all, and in my dream
I thought about the form of the plan
I love her, my friend Elvina,

I am always happy to notice the difference
In a paper cap, for once
I'm sad, but I'm not sad,
In the previousroast-beefblooded,
It's all cling. The ying is included,
In both hearts, the heat extinguished;
In heart letters as unsalked!
In the great scattering looked,
In the rayry, impatiently bald,
It's like a tribute to the finished land.
I will hear your magic voice!
In the wilderly sounder than the lyr voice,
Italian Nights of the Golden
I ruined a lot of life!
I was born for a peaceful life,
It's like a shadow of a faithful wife.
I mean, he knew how to judge,

I was befriending him at the time.
I read a little, I drink for a long time,
I have been patient with the ballets for a long time,
I remember another time!
I also caught the glory in the meantime.
It is a joke to be insane,
It is time for Eugene,
It was Eugene,
Inshoot the medicine,
In front of Onegin gathered
In the days of amusing and desires

I read, read, and all in no sense:
In that conscience, there is no sense;
In front of the dead houses

I will give the fruit of my work:
In the pre-mirrors held
I'll enjoy it in the will,
I love their legs; only not only
I looked old
In the cherished sometimes dreams
Interpreted by Soy and Bentham,
Inherence provided them,
Insane, you're gonna forget them?
It was not occupied by him.
In my soul will completely calm:
I remember the sea in the thunderstorm:
In his clothes was a pedant

It's a vessy again, love again!

I remember, not without sin,
I often hear the question:
In winter, on the cast iron,
Invents for fun,
It's the camp will get a thing, it'll develop
In the spring on the ant of the buto.

In Moldova, in the wilders of the steppes,

I've still loved balls.
I was crazy about balls:
Involuntary devotion to the dreams,
If it weren't for the manners,
It is a beast of hope and sadness,
I liked his traits,
It was the life of both of us.
In Chronological Dust
It is a yus.
In whole windows of the shadows,
In the very third of our days.
I was embarrassed by; but I'm used to
I am very glad that the previous path
Keep your lornet straight!
I finally saw the light.
It is worth is is; it,
It's time to find it,
It's like you's done it.
Inscenced oddity
It's a hit to sit.
I'm hostile to the elements
In their captivative footprints
I don't catch batchest.
I could have light in the for scientists
Intex with conditional beauty
It's a talky, it's mut,
Keeping the Silence in an Important Dispute
I will depict in the picture faithful

I want to warn you.
I was angry, he was ugly;
I have revised all this strictly:
It was a deep economy,
In the Academic Dictionary.
It's a monotonous and a variety.

My young days rushed.
The deceased was buried.
Three houses for the evening called:
Two legs... Sad, chooled,
Then they were dreamed.
The new ballet started.
The betrayals have time to be exhausted;
Their image of the secret has preserved;
Still outside and inside

There was no time for me to walk and:

Sleeping calmly in the shadow of the blessed

Of course it would be brave,
To make believe, to believe,
Songs in twenty-five.
The language of the Petrarch and love.

Onegin at home locked himself,
To breathe and think to yourself:
The owner is full, and the village

Parter and chairs - everything is boiling;
The merchant stands, the crassmanner is coming,
The magnificent house is shining;
The noise was pleasant in the morning.
Music is tired of rattundering;
Useful fishing by choosing,

To blame a minute of tossing,
The repentance is biting.
That's why I'm writing,
Under the guise of storms, with waves arguing,
One breath, one loving,
Monsieur l'Abbé, the Frenchman's brog,
Only a boat, a sankhovyah,
Please note my speech:
Luxury touch.

No matter how we fought, to distinguish.

Touch the cut of your feet with your mouth!

There's bored, there's deceiving and delusional,
Spirits in face-range crystal;
On the third grod, hill and field
On the mirrored floor hall,
So the piet is full,
The blind Fortune and the People
Mott in a lot less could
So I didn't torfor mine's soul!
Onegin was ready with me
The murmur of a quiet stream;
The fact that I belong to them.
No songs inspired by them:
Nothing touched him,
Sme the nails in front of him,
Notes are carried to him.
Oh! I could not forget for a long time
Tom has no charm,
Onegin was according to many
The conditions of light overwalken the burden,
Loved the soft are the movlens
So inapperignable to men,
The imagination is boiling again,
Sensitive, careless again,
Then I'll start writing
On sighs, bosers and deceiving
The desire and passion to win,
Latin is now out of fashion:
Saw the last fashion,
The science of tender passion,
Newborn creation,
To be prayed and to demand recognition,
The beauties weren't long
No grossing of light, not Boston,
To be dark, to be torn,
So that the child is not to be torn,
The wine of the comet was thrown.
That's how we're dreamed of
More glasses ardors ask for
Sudden of Sudden he actually got
The Proud Lire of Albion
No, never a vesm of passion
There is no place for recognition
On the northern, sad snow
She, prophesying the look
Swiss past a arrow
Tossed, cough, shutt, clap;
On the furs at the entrance sleep;
The well is carried over the sleep,
Maneus were in the ship.
The drum is waking up.

Satire is a brave ruler,
To retell me a lack of aiser;

So majestic, so clever,
On the stock is drawn by the drawer,
One foot touching the floor,
The theater is an evil legislator,
Running a stormy erre
Singing the Torquat octas!
No women's legs, no heads;
To the mouth of the Young Armids,
United fields,
Love of dreaming friends.
Lovely, dear friends!
Now from you, my friends,
There are no streets, no palaces,
Remes the old years of romances,
On the beds of unfassed ladies;
The series set the series,
that serpension of memories,
Seeing foreign countries;
Under a long tableset of tables,
The other slowly circles,
The apostal of turbulent pleasures,
No maps, no balls, no verses.
O you, honored spouses!
Three pairs of thaired women's legs.
to understand the epigraphs,
The sea is on the granite of rocks.
Thinking about the beauty of nails:
Lively creative dreams.
Near the unfinished poems,
To whom, in the crowd of jealous virgins,
They are not worth the passions,
There are a lot of contradictions,
The magic land! There in the old years,
The happiness of the young years,
Magic sounds, feelings and thoughts;
The subject of his usual thoughts;
To tarit hope, to be jealous,
To correct his pillows,
The ghost of non-graved days:
My happiest days?
Still, essing, the horses beat,
Ready to patentrechat,
Moin call (for that,
Unwitting affecture to expect,
They's bayy... like their feet.
The child was a cut, but sweet.
Pour hot fat of the cutlet,
That's what a young hanging thought,
She took a little bit of it.
Snow is tiled under it.
That I have maritaled my portrait,
The Adam Smith
Scientary, but pedant:
The long-time student,
The cheerful viewer is indifferent,
Squeal of his lot,
The goddess goes to the masquot.
The fate of Eugene kept:
They're disturbing my heart.
